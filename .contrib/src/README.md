# ATT C# tools

Open `Parser/Parser.sln` for Parser and CSVCleaner, `Blizzard_API_Harvester/Blizzard API Harvester.sln` for the three Harvester tools, and `Profession_Automator/Profession Automator.sln` for Profession Automator. The six tools under `.contrib/.source` keep their original directories, project filenames and `All The Tools.sln`; migrating that source tree is separate work. Install the .NET Framework 4.7.2 and 4.8 targeting packs and a .NET SDK supporting the existing .NET 8 tools.

## Restore and build

From the repository root, use Visual Studio MSBuild:

```bat
msbuild ".contrib\src\Parser\Parser.sln" /restore /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /m:1
msbuild ".contrib\src\Blizzard_API_Harvester\Blizzard API Harvester.sln" /restore /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release "/p:Platform=Any CPU" /m:1
msbuild ".contrib\src\Profession_Automator\Profession Automator.sln" /restore /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /m:1
msbuild ".contrib\.source\All The Tools.sln" /restore /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /m:1
```

Use `Debug` for debug builds. On an ARM64 Windows host with an ARM64 .NET SDK, add `/p:NETCoreSdkRuntimeIdentifier=win-x64` to preserve the existing x64 apphosts for the Any CPU tools.

Both source roots contain the same `Directory.Build.props`, which restores NuGet packages into each project's ignored `packages` directory and excludes that cache from SDK source globs. No pre-populated package directories or `.tools` managed DLLs are needed to build.

## Managed dependency ownership

| Project | Owned dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| Parser | Csv 2.0.93, NLua 1.5.7, KeraLua 1.2.13 |
| Database | NLua 1.5.7, KeraLua 1.2.13 |
| ATT Sync Tool | Database project reference; inherits its packages |
| Item Database Consolidator | NLua 1.5.7, KeraLua 1.2.13 |
| Profession_Automator | NLua 1.5.7, KeraLua 1.2.13 |
| Blizzard_API_Harvester | Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client 5.2.3, Newtonsoft.Json 13.0.3 |
| Skill Level Requirements | Newtonsoft.Json 13.0.3 |
| AssetDB Builder, IconID Converter, CSVCleaner, Classic_Item_Detector, Item_DB_Compare_Tool | Framework APIs and project source |

The explicit KeraLua 1.2.13 references preserve the runtime version: NLua 1.5.7 alone declares a minimum of KeraLua 1.2.12. All Lua projects use NLua 1.5.7 and KeraLua 1.2.13; both Newtonsoft consumers use 13.0.3. Versions remain explicit in their owner projects. Database, ATT Sync Tool, Item Database Consolidator, Skill Level Requirements, AssetDB Builder and IconID Converter remain under `.contrib/.source`; the other six projects remain under `.contrib/src`. Migrated `src` tool executable names use underscores; legacy `.source` output names are preserved.

Profession's table conversion accepts NLua 1.5.7's `Int64` integer values alongside `Double` values, preserving IDs and nested numeric data.

## Runtime outputs

`.contrib/.tools` remains the shared runtime output and script interface. It is never a managed build dependency source. Parser, Database and Consolidator all produce the same NuGet NLua/KeraLua bytes there, and Sync receives Database's runtime closure through its project reference. Profession produces the same NuGet Lua dependencies in its separate output directory.

Skill produces Newtonsoft.Json 13.0.3 under `.tools`; Harvester produces the same package version under `.contrib/Harvesters`, along with WebAPI 5.2.3 and the generated JSON binding redirect.

Existing native Lua handling is retained. KeraLua's NuGet build targets still copy the same native assets as the previous explicit imports; this change adds no runtime identifiers or native layout.
