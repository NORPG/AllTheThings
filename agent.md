# ATT Agent Guidelines (Draft)

Status: Draft; these guidelines are already in effect and must be followed while the document is reviewed and refined.

These guidelines apply to contributions to AllTheThings (ATT), including code, data, documentation, pull requests, and issues. AI-specific requirements apply whenever AI assistance is used.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

- PRs and issues must disclose AI assistance whenever AI was used to implement the related work or to prepare their content.
- The disclosure must identify the actual model name(s) and describe what AI helped with, such as implementation, data analysis, documentation, or drafting the report.
- Every PR must contain an `AI Assistance` section. If no AI was used, state: `No AI assistance was used for this contribution.`
- For AI-assisted issues, add an `AI Assistance` section to the issue description. When using an existing issue form, place it in `Additional Context` or the equivalent free-text field.
- Describe assistance and verification accurately. Do not claim human review, testing, or source verification that did not occur.

## Commit Messages and Attribution

- Use the commit subject format `[<Category>] <summary>.`, ending with a period. Capitalize the first letter of the bracketed category. For example: `[Docs] Add draft ATT agent guidelines.`
- Keep the complete commit subject at 60 characters or fewer, including the bracketed category, spaces, and final period.
- Describe the actual content or code changes and their resulting behavior in the subject and body. Omit references to user instructions or the agent's workflow.
- Describe detailed changes in the commit body, separated from the subject by a blank line.

Every commit containing AI-assisted work must include the following trailer at the end of its commit message:

```text
Assisted-by: <model name>
```

Replace `<model name>` with the actual model used. If multiple models contributed to a commit, add one `Assisted-by:` trailer per model. Do not substitute a tool or product name for an unknown model name; obtain the model name before committing. Preserve applicable attribution when amending or squashing commits.

## PR Descriptions

Every PR must include:

- `Summary`: Explain the purpose of the contribution and summarize the changes.
- `AI Assistance`: Include the disclosure described above, even when no AI was used.

PRs introducing new features must also include a `Feature Introduction` section covering:

- What the feature does and the problem or use case it addresses.
- How users enable or use it, including relevant commands or settings.
- The expected behavior and any relevant limitations or compatibility constraints.

PRs changing ATT data must also include a `Data Sources` section as described below.

## Sources for Data Changes

- Every data addition, correction, or removal must be supported by an in-game screenshot, an ATT Contribute data export (`Contributor Report`), or a Wowhead source.
- When using Wowhead as a source, include a direct link to the relevant page in the PR or related issue.
- Attach the evidence directly to the PR or related issue, or link to accessible evidence. If evidence is attached to an issue, link that issue from the PR and identify the relevant attachment or report.
- Identify the affected records, such as item, quest, achievement, NPC, or object IDs, and explain which evidence supports each change or group of changes.
- Include the relevant WoW flavour and client build, ATT version, and any region, event, location, or observation date needed to interpret the evidence.
- AI-generated explanations or inferred values do not replace source evidence. Do not fabricate screenshots, exports, or observations.
- If evidence is missing, identify the affected changes as unverified in the draft and obtain the evidence before presenting them as ready for review.
